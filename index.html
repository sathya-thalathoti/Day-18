          <h2>Red Carpets Roar Back</h2>
          <p>
            The star-studded spectacles have returned in full force since the
            actors’ union strike ended. So has the fashion.

            When the actors’ union went on strike, many could not promote their
            projects. The future of red carpets quickly became a topic of
            concern. But within days of the strike ending in early November,
            celebrities had again begun stepping out in their finest borrowed
            garments and those fears disappeared faster than the flash of a
            flashbulb.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After the strike-induced hiatus, and with awards season now
            underway, outfits have gotten bolder. We’ve seen real-life Wonkas,
            daring silhouettes and, despite the time of year, lots of shirtless
            men.
          </p>

          <p>
            The looks on this list are highlights from red carpets in November
            and December. Consider them a taste of what to expect as some of the
            biggest events of the coming year kick off in January.The star of
            “Wonka” dressed the part at the film’s world premiere, pairing a
            purplish suit with chocolate-brown boots.
